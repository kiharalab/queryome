    "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease with many serious chronic complications. An improvement in the oral antidiabetic medication in respect to its mechanism of action and toxicology was needed in order to have effective therapies with high compliance and minimum side effects. In this context, metformin is a widely used oral antidiabetic drug, which, through its mechanism of action, has no risk of hypoglycemia. However, a rare but serious side effect of biguanides is lactic acidosis. This paper presents a number of 13 cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, which outline the circumstances triggering the adverse event and the clinical therapeutic measures applied in the poisoned patients. The main situations that favor metformin-associated lactic acidosis are renal impairment and tissue hypoxia, and the intervention is adapted to the particular patient condition and symptoms, such as marked hypotension and cardiac arrest. Although there are commonalities in describing the consulted patients, the final prognosis is not dependent on the dose or metformin plasma levels, but rather on the associated pathologies and medication.",

Many studies have shown the beneficial effect of metformin on glucose control. The recent UK Prospective Diabetes Study has proven the effectiveness of metformin for any diabetes related endpoint. Frequent side effects of metformin are nausea, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. Most side effects disappear after decreasing the dosage, although in 5% of patients diarrhoea only disappears after discontinuation of metformin.

    "text": "INTRODUCTION: Digestive disorders represent the most common metformin related side-effects in type 2 diabetics. GI side effects of metformin are not so uncommon rather under reported or wrongly diagnosed as primary gastrointestinal disorder. This study is to estimate metformin related GI side effects in Indian population.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective cross sectional study, conducted in tertiary care hospital at Kota. 120 type 2 diabetic patients were included after detailed history, physical examination and inclusion/exclusion criteria, who were on metformin tablet only, for variable duration. All patients were evaluated for gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nRESULTS: Mean age of study group was 52.8\u00b111.9 years with mean weight 72.4\u00b110.3 kg. Mean duration of metformin therapy was 3 years (6 weeks to 6 years) and mean metformin dose was 1000mg (500 mg - 2500 mg). 62 (51.66%) patients presented with GI side effects. These side effects are diarrhea (33), nausea/vomiting (28), pain abdomen (23), flatulence (16), retching (13), dysgeusia (7). On the basis of duration of therapy, most of patients had side effects during initial phase of treatment but some patients also presented after long duration of treatment.\n\nCONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal side effects being most common side effect of metformin can lead to discontinuation of therapy. So before extensive evaluation of any GI problem in patient on metformin, other methods can be tried like temporary discontinuation, dose titration or proper intake of medicine. These side effects may also occur even after prolonged treatment with metformin.",

For metformin, the most common side effects are diarrhea and dyspepsia, occurring in up to 30% of patients. The most important and serious side effect is lactic acidosis. Phenformin was removed from the markets before 1970, because it caused lactic acidosis in 40-65 patients in 100,000 patient-years. Metformin causes lactate accumulation only in patients who have hepatic failure, renal failure or in patients who attempt suicide with high dosage of drugs.

All other authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nBackground: Metformin is the only approved first-line oral glucose lowering agent for youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Y-T2DM) but often causes gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, which may contribute to reduced treatment adherence and efficacy. Prebiotic intake may reduce metformin's side effects by shifting microbiota composition and activity.\n\nObjective: The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility and tolerability of a prebiotic supplement to improve metformin-induced GI symptoms and explore the changes in glycemia and shifts in the microbiota diversity.\n\nMethods: In a two-phase pilot clinical trial, we compared, stool frequency and stool form every 1-2 days, and composite lower GI symptoms (weekly) at initiation of daily metformin combined with either a daily prebiotic or a placebo shake in a 1-week randomized double-blind crossover design (Phase 1), followed by a 1-month open-labeled extension (Phase 2). Plasma glycemic markers and stool samples were collected before and after each phase.\n\nResults: Six Y-T2DM (17.2 \u00b1 1.7y (mean \u00b1 SD), 67% male, BMI (42 \u00b1 9 kg/m\n\nConclusion: Administration of a prebiotic fiber supplement during short-term metformin therapy was well tolerated in Y-T2DM and associated with modest shifts in microbial composition. This study provides a proof-of-concept for feasibility exploring prebiotic-metformin-microbiome interactions as a basis for adjunctive metformin therapy.\n\nClinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT04209075.",

A total of 643 preferred terms (PTs) and 27 system organ classes (SOCs) that were significant disproportionality conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were included. The SOCs included metabolic and nutritional disorders (\n\nCONCLUSION: Most of our results were consistent with the specification, but some new signals of adverse reactions such as acute pancreatitis were not included. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate unlabeled adverse reactions and provide important support for clinical monitoring and risk identification of metformin.",

    "text": "AIM: Treatment of type 2 diabetes with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may be limited by gastrointestinal side effects (GISE) in some patients. Risk factors for developing GISE are not known. We analysed patient characteristics that were associated with GISE among patients treated with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide.\n\nMETHODS: Data was obtained from an audit database of liraglutide use based in clinical practice in the UK. Patients were grouped into those who did not report GISE, those who reported GISE but continued liraglutide and those who discontinued liraglutide due to GISE within 26 weeks of treatment. Baseline variables of age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, weight, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, gender, ethnicity, alanine transaminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and diabetes treatment types were tested for possible associations with GISE outcome. Significant variables in univariate analyses were entered into ordinal logistic regression analyses.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 4442 patients were suitable for analysis. A total of 3905 (87.9%) did not report GISE, 297 (6.7%) and 240 (5.4%) had GISE and continued and discontinued treatment, respectively. Age, weight, eGFR, metformin status and insulin status were associated with GISE outcome in univariate analyses (P all <0.05). In the final regression model, age (adjusted OR 1.15 [95%CI 1.05,1.26], P=0.002) and non-metformin use (adjusted OR 0.76 [95%CI 0.60,0.96], P=0.020) were associated with worse GISE outcome.\n\nCONCLUSION: Older age and non-metformin use were associated with more significant GISE leading to discontinuation of liraglutide treatment. The reasons for these findings are unclear and warrant further investigation.",

Data extracted included patient demographics, medical history and co-existing conditions, metformin dosage and relevant pathology results.\n\nRESULT: A total of 152 cases of suspected MALA were included in this study. For 20 patients the outcome was unknown. There were 23 patients (n=132, 17.4%) reported as deceased. Plasma lactate levels were higher in non-survivors (p=0.02). Thirty-five patients (n=132, 26.5%) were reported to have at least one pre-existing contraindication to the use of metformin; this proportion was not different between patients who died or survived. Renal impairment was the most common contraindication. Approximately 75% of patients were reported to have at least one clinical condition which might cause acidosis. Metformin dosage, plasma lactate and serum creatinine were not correlated. Based on the cases reported to the TGA, the incidence of MALA in Australia was estimated to be 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.1) cases per 100,000 patient-years between 1997 and 2011.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pre-existing clinical conditions, such as renal impairment, and acute illnesses associated with lactic acidosis were frequently reported in the cases of MALA. The estimated incidence of MALA was lower than in most previous studies in other countries, probably due to the nature of spontaneous reports to the TGA.",

The patient had no previous history of psychiatric or sleep disorders. However, it was the first time he had experienced such recurrent nightmares, especially after the start of 500 mg metformin thrice a day.

    "text": "INTRODUCTION: Metformin is among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide for a variety of indications. Although metformin has several important advantages, for example being easy to store and administer, it is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Slower-release formulations of metformin may reduce the incidence of side effects while maintaining efficacy; however, there is a lack of systematic evidence available to guide head-to-head comparisons between different metformin formulations.\n\nMETHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, OVID EMBASE, MEDLINE, The Cochrane database and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched (from inception to 25\u00a0January 2021). Trials that randomized adult participants to extended-release formulation of metformin (met-XR), delayed-release (met-DR) or immediate-release metformin (met-IR) were included. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk-of-bias, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, BMI, lipid profile and side effects. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.\n\nRESULTS: Fifteen studies (n\u2009=\u20093765) met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p\u2009=\u20090.93). A non-significant reduction in mean body weight was observed in individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR (-\u20091.03\u00a0kg, 95% CI -\u00a02.12 to 0.05, p\u2009=\u20090.06). Individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (-\u20095.73\u00a0mg/dl, 95% CI -\u00a07.91 to -\u00a03.56, p\u2009<\u20090.00001). Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.80, p\u2009=\u20090.006).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate equal efficacy of longer-acting formulations (met-XR, met-DR) versus immediate-release metformin formulations in terms of glycaemic control. There were insufficient studies available to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations outside of diabetes care. However met-XR was associated with reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations, while met-DR was strongly associated with reduced GI side effects, which could improve drug compliance.",

A prediction model was established using integrated or simplified indicators. Ten machine learning models were used for the construction of predictive models. The Shapley values were used to report the features' contribution.\n\nRESULTS: Four randomised clinical trial cohorts, including 1736 patients with type 2 diabetes, were first included in the analysis. Seventy percent of participants (1216) were allocated to the training set, 15% (260) were assigned to the internal validation set and 15% (260) were assigned to the test set. The Extra Tree model had the highest area under curve (AUC) (0.87) in the validation and test set. The top five crucial indicators were blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sex, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC), and these five indicators were selected for constructing a simplified predictive model (AUC\u2009=\u20090.76). An online web-based tool was established based on the predictive model with integrated 17 features and top five indicators.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: To predict gastrointestinal side effects in diabetic patients for initial use of metformin, a few easily obtained features are needed to establish the model. The model can be applied to the Chinese population in clinical practice.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize earlier findings on the association between metformin use and risk of fracture.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic search on all published articles up to October 2018 using online databases including PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus. Observational studies that considered metformin use as the exposure variable and bone fracture as the main outcome variable or as one of the outcome variables and participants included were 18\u00a0years and older were included in the systematic review. Publications in which hazard ratios (HRs), rate or risk ratios (RRs), or odds ratios (ORs) were reported as effect size were included in the meta-analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Totally, three cohort studies, one cross-sectional study, one nested case-control study, and one case-control study were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. When seven effect sizes from six studies were combined, a significant inverse association between metformin use and risk of fracture was observed (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.72, 0.93).

    "text": "Background and Aim: A growing body of evidence suggests that preadmission metformin use could decrease the mortality of septic patients with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, the findings remain controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted on available studies to confirm the relationship between preadmission metformin use and mortality in patients with sepsis and DM.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed for studies published before August 8, 2021. Observational studies assessing the correlation between metformin use and mortality in patients with sepsis and DM were considered eligible studies. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the outcome quality of each included article. Furthermore, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (\n\nResults: Eleven articles including 8195 patients were analyzed in this meta-analysis. All the included articles were scored as low risk of bias. Our results showed that preadmission metformin use had a lower mortality rate (OR, 0.74; 95%\n\nConclusions: This study is the most comprehensive meta-analysis at present, which shows that preadmission metformin use may reduce mortality and not increase the levels of serum creatinine and lactic acid in adult patients with sepsis and DM. Therefore, these data suggest that the potential efficacy of metformin could be assessed in future clinical studies.\n\nSystematic Review Registration: https://inplasy.com/?s=INPLASY2021100113, identifier INPLASY2021100113.",

    "text": "Introduction: Metformin is the first choice drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus but its administration may be linked to gastrointestinal adverse events limiting its use.\n\nObjectives: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events related to metformin use in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin.\n\nMethods: PUB MED/CINAHL/Web of Science/Scopus were searched from database inception until 08.11.2020 for articles in English and randomized controlled trials related to patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin were included.\n\nResults: From 5315 publications, we identified 199 potentially eligible full-text articles. Finally, 71 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. In these studies, metformin use was associated with higher risk of abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea comparing to control. The risks of abdominal pain and nausea were highest comparing to placebo. Bloating risk was only elevated when metformin treatment was compared to DPP4i.\n\nConclusions: The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events such as abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea is higher in type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin compared to other antidiabetic drugs. There is a higher risk of bloating and diarrhea with metformin immediate-release than with metformin extended release formulation.\n\nSystematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021289975, identifier CRD42021289975.",
