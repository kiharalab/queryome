Finally, 71 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. In these studies, metformin use was associated with higher risk of abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea comparing to control. The risks of abdominal pain and nausea were highest comparing to placebo. Bloating risk was only elevated when metformin treatment was compared to DPP4i.\n\nConclusions: The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events such as abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea is higher in type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin compared to other antidiabetic drugs. There is a higher risk of bloating and diarrhea with metformin immediate-release than with metformin extended release formulation.\n\nSystematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021289975, identifier CRD42021289975."

      "text": "BACKGROUND: The objective was to capture the breadth of outcomes that have been associated with metformin use and to systematically assess the quality, strength and credibility of these associations using the umbrella review methodology.\n\nMETHODS: Four major databases were searched until 31 May 2020. Meta-analyses of observational studies and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (including active and placebo control arms) were included.\n\nRESULTS: From 175 eligible publications, we identified 427 different meta-analyses, including 167 meta-analyses of observational studies, 147 meta-analyses of RCTs for metformin vs placebo/no treatment and 113 meta-analyses of RCTs for metformin vs active medications. There was no association classified as convincing or highly suggestive from meta-analyses of observational studies, but some suggestive/weak associations of metformin use with a lower mortality risk of CVD and cancer. In meta-analyses of RCTs, metformin was associated with a lower incidence of diabetes in people with prediabetes or no diabetes at baseline; lower ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome incidence (in women in controlled ovarian stimulation); higher success for clinical pregnancy rate in poly-cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and significant reduction in body mass index in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in women who have obesity/overweight with PCOS and in obese/overweight women. Of 175 publications, 166 scored as low or critically low quality per AMSTAR 2 criteria.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Observational evidence on metformin seems largely unreliable. Randomized evidence shows benefits for preventing diabetes and in some gynaecological and obstetrical settings. However, almost all meta-analyses are of low or critically low quality according to AMSTAR 2 criteria."

We thus conduct a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after AMI in patients with T2DM.\n\nMETHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we will search PUBMED, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through April, 2021. The study is structured to adhere to PRISMA guidelines (i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). The literature search, data extraction, and quality assessments are conducted independently by 2 authors. Outcome measures include all-cause mortality; complications such as acute kidney injury, lactic acidosis, hospitalization for AMI or stroke, or death. Where disagreement in the collection of data occurs, this is resolved through discussion. Review Manager Software (v 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration) is used for the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included studies at study level.\n\nRESULTS: It is hypothesized that metformin use at the post-AMI is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with T2DM.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study expects to provide credible and scientific evidence for the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after AMI in patients with T2DM.\n\nREGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/S3MBP."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION: Metformin is among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide for a variety of indications. Although metformin has several important advantages, for example being easy to store and administer, it is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Slower-release formulations of metformin may reduce the incidence of side effects while maintaining efficacy; however, there is a lack of systematic evidence available to guide head-to-head comparisons between different metformin formulations.\n\nMETHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, OVID EMBASE, MEDLINE, The Cochrane database and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched (from inception to 25 January 2021). Trials that randomized adult participants to extended-release formulation of metformin (met-XR), delayed-release (met-DR) or immediate-release metformin (met-IR) were included. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk-of-bias, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, BMI, lipid profile and side effects. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.\n\nRESULTS: Fifteen studies (n = 3765) met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p = 0.93). A non-significant reduction in mean body weight was observed in individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR (- 1.03 kg, 95% CI - 2.12 to 0.05, p = 0.06). Individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (- 5.73 mg/dl, 95% CI - 7.91 to - 3.56, p < 0.00001). Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.80, p = 0.006).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate equal efficacy of longer-acting formulations (met-XR, met-DR) versus immediate-release metformin formulations in terms of glycaemic control. There were insufficient studies available to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations outside of diabetes care. However met-XR was associated with reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations, while met-DR was strongly associated with reduced GI side effects, which could improve drug compliance."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION: Metformin is the most prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); there is a well-established link with the elevated incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) limiting its administration or intensification.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was to evaluate the pooled incidence of GI AE related to metformin use in patients with T2DM.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: PUB MED/CINAHL/Web of Science/Scopus were searched from database inception until 29.07.2024 for observational studies in English describing the frequency of GI AE in patients with T2DM treated with metformin. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive effect sizes: event rates.\n\nRESULTS: From 7019 publications, we identified 211 potentially eligible full-text articles. Ultimately, 21 observational studies were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of GI AE was as follows: diarrhea 6.9% (95% CI: 0.038-0.123), bloating 6,2% (95% CI: 0.020-0.177), abdominal pain 5,3% (95% CI: 0.003-0.529), vomiting 2.4% (95%: CI 0.007-0.075), constipation 1.1% (95%: CI 0.001-0.100). The incidence of bloating (coefficient -4.46; p < 0.001), diarrhea (coefficient -1.17; p = 0.0951) abdominal pain (coefficient -2.80; p = 0.001), constipation (coefficient -5.78; p = 0.0014) and vomiting (coefficient -2.47; p < 0.001) were lower for extended release (XR) metformin than metformin immediate release (IR) formulation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prevalence of GI AE in patients receiving metformin, with a diarrhea predominance, followed by bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting. The incidence is lower in patients administered with XR metformin.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021289975 , identifier CRD42021289975."

This meta-analysis followed the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2022, to collect the studies that reported the effect of metformin on the deficiency of vitamin B12 in patients with T2DM and the factors associated with it. A total of 17 studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Among all the included studies, 13 were cross-sectional studies, 3 were retrospective cohorts, and one was a case-control study. The pooled rate of deficiency of vitamin B12 in patients receiving metformin (23.16%) was significantly higher compared to patients who were not on metformin (17.4%) (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 2.18-4.00, p-value: 0.001). Factors significantly associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2DM and receiving metformin include the duration of metformin use and a greater dose of metformin. In conclusion, our meta-analysis found that the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency is greater in patients receiving metformin compared to patients who did not receive metformin. Given the importance of vitamin B12 in nutrition, metformin-induced B12 decrease may be harmful to patients with T2DM. Supplemental vitamin B12 may be advantageous for those on metformin."

Data were summarized as mean differences (MD) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) and pooled under the random effects model.\n\nFINDINGS: Fourteen RCTs (17 comparisons, 1009 patients) were included in this systematic review. Pooled results show a significant decrease in fasting glucose (FG) (MD = -0.64, 95 % CI = -1.06, -0.22) and HbA1c (MD = -0.29, 95 % CI = -0.47, -0.10) levels in patients with T2DM treated with metformin plus probiotics versus metformin alone. The addition of probiotics to metformin resulted in lower odds of gastrointestinal adverse events (Odds ratio = 0.18, 95 % CI = 0.09, 0.3.8; I\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The addition of probiotics to metformin therapy is associated with improvement in T2DM outcomes. However, high-quality and adequately reported RCTs are needed in the future to confirm our findings."
