      "text": "BACKGROUND: The objective was to capture the breadth of outcomes that have been associated with metformin use and to systematically assess the quality, strength and credibility of these associations using the umbrella review methodology.\n\nMETHODS: Four major databases were searched until 31 May 2020. Meta-analyses of observational studies and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (including active and placebo control arms) were included.\n\nRESULTS: From 175 eligible publications, we identified 427 different meta-analyses, including 167 meta-analyses of observational studies, 147 meta-analyses of RCTs for metformin vs placebo/no treatment and 113 meta-analyses of RCTs for metformin vs active medications. There was no association classified as convincing or highly suggestive from meta-analyses of observational studies, but some suggestive/weak associations of metformin use with a lower mortality risk of CVD and cancer. In meta-analyses of RCTs, metformin was associated with a lower incidence of diabetes in people with prediabetes or no diabetes at baseline; lower ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome incidence (in women in controlled ovarian stimulation); higher success for clinical pregnancy rate in poly-cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and significant reduction in body mass index in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in women who have obesity/overweight with PCOS and in obese/overweight women. Of 175 publications, 166 scored as low or critically low quality per AMSTAR 2 criteria.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Observational evidence on metformin seems largely unreliable. Randomized evidence shows benefits for preventing diabetes and in some gynaecological and obstetrical settings. However, almost all meta-analyses are of low or critically low quality according to AMSTAR 2 criteria."

      "text": "Metformin (Met), a first-line management for type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been expansively employed and studied with results indicating its therapeutic potential extending beyond glycemic control. Beyond its established role, this therapeutic drug demonstrates a broad spectrum of action encompassing over 60 disorders, encompassing metabolic conditions, inflammatory disorders, carcinomas, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular pathologies. There is clear evidence of Met's action targeting specific nodes in the molecular pathways of these diseases and, intriguingly, interactions with the intestinal microbiota and epigenetic processes have been explored. Furthermore, novel Met derivatives with structural modifications tailored to diverse diseases have been synthesized and assessed. This manuscript proffers a comprehensive thematic review of the diseases amenable to Met treatment, elucidates their molecular mechanisms, and employs informatics technology to prospect future therapeutic applications of Met. These data and insights gleaned considerably contribute to enriching our understanding and appreciation of Met's far-reaching clinical potential and therapeutic applicability."

We thus conduct a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after AMI in patients with T2DM.\n\nMETHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we will search PUBMED, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through April, 2021. The study is structured to adhere to PRISMA guidelines (i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). The literature search, data extraction, and quality assessments are conducted independently by 2 authors. Outcome measures include all-cause mortality; complications such as acute kidney injury, lactic acidosis, hospitalization for AMI or stroke, or death. Where disagreement in the collection of data occurs, this is resolved through discussion. Review Manager Software (v 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration) is used for the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included studies at study level.\n\nRESULTS: It is hypothesized that metformin use at the post-AMI is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with T2DM.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study expects to provide credible and scientific evidence for the efficacy and safety of metformin on cardiovascular outcomes after AMI in patients with T2DM.\n\nREGISTRATION NUMBER: 10.17605/OSF.IO/S3MBP."

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) up to September 1, 2023. Five eligible studies were included. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of developing diabetes between the metformin and lifestyle intervention groups (RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.77-1.68). Similarly, when comparing metformin with lifestyle intervention, the risk of diabetes was slightly higher in the metformin group, but this difference was not statistically significant (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.93-1.86). When comparing metformin with lifestyle intervention to lifestyle intervention alone, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of diabetes (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.74-1.04). In conclusion, our analysis found that the incidence of type 2 diabetes was slightly higher in patients receiving metformin alone compared to lifestyle intervention, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Further trials are necessary to better evaluate these interventions for preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals."

      "text": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of metformin against placebo, diet, oral anti-diabetics, or insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nDESIGN: Systematic review.\n\nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1974-2003), LILACS (1986-2003), Cochrane library (Issue 3, 2003).\n\nSELECTION OF STUDIES: 29 randomized clinical trials of metformin in monotherapy, with results on mortality, morbidity, and biochemistry. EXTRACTION OF DATA: RevMan 4 computer program. Two reviewers extracted the data and evaluated the quality.\n\nMAIN VARIABLES: any clinical event related to diabetes (mortality, coronary disease, stroke, arterial disease, and retinopathy). Secondary variables: weight and biochemistry.\n\nRESULTS: 29 clinical studies with 37 comparisons of metformin were analyzed (13 with sulphonylureas, 12 with placebo, 3 with diet, 3 with thiazolidinediones, 2 with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, 2 with insulin, and 2 with meglitinides). Metformin was more beneficial than the sulphonylureas or insulin for any clinical event associated with diabetes (relative risk [RR]=0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.94) and than diet (RR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.90). Metformin decreased glycosylated hemoglobin A1 (weighted mean difference, -1.21%; 95% CI, -1.48 to -0.94), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (weighted mean difference, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.40 to -0.09), and weight (standardized mean difference, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.18 to -0.04). Metformin was more beneficial than the placebo, diet or the thiazolidinediones on glycosylated hemoglobin A1, and than the sulphonylureas or insulin on weight.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In the long term metformin reduces the risks of clinical events associated with diabetes. There are no long term clinical trials which compare alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones with metformin, in primary results. The different treatments compared with metformin did not obtain more benefit for the secondary results evaluated."

      "text": "This review article explores the potential of metformin, a medication commonly used for type 2 diabetes, as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Metformin has demonstrated inhibitory effects on the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models and has shown promising results in reducing viral load and achieving undetectable viral levels in clinical trials. Additionally, metformin exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulating immune cell function, which may help prevent cytokine storms associated with severe COVID-19. The drug's ability to regulate the balance between pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and anti-inflammatory Treg cells suggests its potential in mitigating inflammation and restoring T cell functionality. Furthermore, metformin's modulation of the gut microbiota, particularly changes in bacterial taxa and the production of short-chain fatty acids, may contribute to its therapeutic effects. The interplay between metformin, bile acids, the gut microbiome, glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion, and glycemic control has implications for the management of diabetes and potential interventions in COVID-19. By refreshing the current evidence, this review highlights the potential of metformin as a therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19, while also exploring its effects on the gut microbiome and immunometabolism."

      "text": "AIMS: The Italian Society of Diabetology and the Italian Association of Clinical Diabetologists are developing new guidelines for drug treatment of type 2 diabetes. The effects of anti-hyperglycaemic drugs on all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were included among the critical clinical outcomes. We have therefore carried out an updated meta-analysis on the effects of metformin on these outcomes.\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with duration ≥52 weeks (published up to August 2020), in which metformin was compared with either placebo/no therapy or active comparators. MACEs (restricted for RCT reporting MACEs within their study endpoints) and all-cause mortality (irrespective of the inclusion of MACEs among the pre-specified endpoints) were considered as the primary endpoints. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR) with 95% confidence interval was calculated for all endpoints considered. Metformin was associated with a nonsignificant reduction of all-cause mortality (n = 13 RCTs; MH-OR 0.80 [95% CI 0.60, 1.07]). However, this association became statistically significant after excluding RCTs comparing metformin with sulfonylureas, SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 analogues (MH-OR 0.71 [0.51, 0.99]). Metformin was associated with a lower risk of MACEs compared with comparator treatments (n = 2 RCTs; MH-OR 0.52 [0.37, 0.73]), p < 0.001. Similar results were obtained in a post-hoc analysis including all RCTs fulfilling criteria for inclusion in the analysis (MH-OR: 0.57 [0.42, 0.76]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This updated meta-analysis suggests that metfomin is significantly associated with lower risk of MACEs and tendentially lower all-cause mortality compared to placebo or other anti-hyperglycaemic drugs."
