Metformin, primarily known as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus, has demonstrated extensive therapeutic applications beyond its foundational role in glycemic control. Emerging research illustrates metformin's potential in managing a variety of disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory conditions, and neuroprotective therapies. Its anticancer capabilities are increasingly being recognized, with studies indicating efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing chemotherapy outcomes. Metformin's role in oncology is attributed to mechanisms such as activation of the AMPK pathway, reduction of mitochondrial respiration, and modulation of cellular energy states and redox status (PMID: 36336804, 38612893).

Moreover, metformin exhibits significant cardiovascular benefits. Research indicates that metformin can lower cardiovascular events in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients through mechanisms involving improved endothelial function and reduced oxidative stress, mediated largely by AMPK activation (PMID: 36052760, 25762117). Furthermore, metformin's potential in the preventive management of cardiovascular conditions includes reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis and heart failure by addressing multiple underlying biological pathways (PMID: 25762117, 36077136).

Key findings include metformin's broad therapeutic spectrum, affecting over 60 conditions beyond diabetes, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndromes (PMID: 37567440). It holds promise as an adjuvant in cancer therapies, enhancing treatment efficacy and survival rates, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers (PMID: 38785784). Additionally, metformin's cardiovascular protective properties are supported by its ability to lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in coronary artery disease patients (PMID: 31362743).

In conclusion, metformin's role in therapeutics extends significantly beyond diabetes management, with demonstrable efficacy in cancer prevention and treatment, cardiovascular protection, and potentially other areas like neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory applications. Its long-established safety profile and affordability make it a viable candidate for repurposing in various clinical settings, warranting further exploration in large-scale clinical trials to solidify its place in managing diverse health conditions beyond glycemic control (PMID: 36972373, 37307806).
