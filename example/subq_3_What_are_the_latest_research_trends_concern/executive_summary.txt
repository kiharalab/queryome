Recent research on metformin, a widely used antidiabetic medication, has broadened beyond its glycemic control in type 2 diabetes to explore its therapeutic potentials in managing various other health conditions, notably cancer. A central focus of current studies is metformin's involvement in modulating key signaling pathways and its impact on metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes. These insights stem from new understandings of the drug's molecular mechanisms involving interactions with the mitochondria, redox signaling, and inflammation processes (PMID: 37016064). Moreover, researchers are investigating the drug's potential applications in cancer therapy, examining its ability to enhance the efficacy of current chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments (PMID: 39595655, 38785784).

Recent literature highlights the extensive therapeutic scope of metformin, indicating its role in over 60 disorders beyond diabetes, including its influence on the gastrointestinal microbiome and epigenetic processes (PMID: 37567440). In cancer, specifically, metformin is recognized for its benefits in downregulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway, modulating autophagy, and reduction of oxidative stress, with particular interest in breast and colorectal cancers. These findings are substantiated by comprehensive reviews showcasing its promises as both a monotherapy and an adjunct to conventional cancer therapies like chemotherapy and targeted therapy (PMID: 38785784, 39669200).

The overarching conclusion from these studies is that metformin's clinical application continues to expand, with significant prospects in areas such as oncology and precision medicine. Ongoing research into its molecular mechanisms and the development of novel drug delivery systems aim to enhance its therapeutic efficacy and broad-spectrum application. The potential integration of metformin in cancer treatment regimens represents a promising shift towards more comprehensive management of metabolic and oncological diseases (PMID: 37567440, 39595655). These developments underscore the importance of continuing investigations into its mechanistic pathways and therapeutic utilities in diverse clinical settings.
