      "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease with many serious chronic complications. An improvement in the oral antidiabetic medication in respect to its mechanism of action and toxicology was needed in order to have effective therapies with high compliance and minimum side effects. In this context, metformin is a widely used oral antidiabetic drug, which, through its mechanism of action, has no risk of hypoglycemia. However, a rare but serious side effect of biguanides is lactic acidosis. This paper presents a number of 13 cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, which outline the circumstances triggering the adverse event and the clinical therapeutic measures applied in the poisoned patients. The main situations that favor metformin-associated lactic acidosis are renal impairment and tissue hypoxia, and the intervention is adapted to the particular patient condition and symptoms, such as marked hypotension and cardiac arrest. Although there are commonalities in describing the consulted patients, the final prognosis is not dependent on the dose or metformin plasma levels, but rather on the associated pathologies and medication."

      "text": "Three patients, 1 man and 2 women, aged 60, 55 and 72 years, had an insufficient glucose regulation with insulin therapy or with sulfonylurea derivatives. They started metformin therapy, after which HbA1c decreased by 0.8-1.8%. One patient had to discontinue metformin therapy due to excessive diarrhoea. Many studies have shown the beneficial effect of metformin on glucose control. The recent UK Prospective Diabetes Study has proven the effectiveness of metformin for any diabetes related endpoint. Frequent side effects of metformin are nausea, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. Most side effects disappear after decreasing the dosage, although in 5% of patients diarrhoea only disappears after discontinuation of metformin. Lactic acidosis is a rare, serious adverse effect of metformin, which can be prevented by carefully observing the contra-indications."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION: Digestive disorders represent the most common metformin related side-effects in type 2 diabetics. GI side effects of metformin are not so uncommon rather under reported or wrongly diagnosed as primary gastrointestinal disorder. This study is to estimate metformin related GI side effects in Indian population.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective cross sectional study, conducted in tertiary care hospital at Kota. 120 type 2 diabetic patients were included after detailed history, physical examination and inclusion/exclusion criteria, who were on metformin tablet only, for variable duration. All patients were evaluated for gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nRESULTS: Mean age of study group was 52.8±11.9 years with mean weight 72.4±10.3 kg. Mean duration of metformin therapy was 3 years (6 weeks to 6 years) and mean metformin dose was 1000mg (500 mg - 2500 mg). 62 (51.66%) patients presented with GI side effects. These side effects are diarrhea (33), nausea/vomiting (28), pain abdomen (23), flatulence (16), retching (13), dysgeusia (7). On the basis of duration of therapy, most of patients had side effects during initial phase of treatment but some patients also presented after long duration of treatment.\n\nCONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal side effects being most common side effect of metformin can lead to discontinuation of therapy. So before extensive evaluation of any GI problem in patient on metformin, other methods can be tried like temporary discontinuation, dose titration or proper intake of medicine. These side effects may also occur even after prolonged treatment with metformin."

However, with the number of patients on metformin increasing the incidence of MALA is likely to increase. We aim to raise the awareness of MALA and prompt acute physicians to consider this diagnosis in the acutely unwell diabetic patient on metformin. We present 3 cases that presented with MALA in the course of 6 months, all of whom survived. We discuss metformin, its effects and lactic acidosis. We encourage effective prompt resuscitation of these individuals to increase survival."

      "text": "Biguanides can function as oral antihyperglycemic drugs. They were used for diabetes mellitus or prediabetes treatment over the last nine decades, but they lost their popularity in 1970s because of phenformin and regained with metformin. For metformin, the most common side effects are diarrhea and dyspepsia, occurring in up to 30% of patients. The most important and serious side effect is lactic acidosis. Phenformin was removed from the markets before 1970, because it caused lactic acidosis in 40-65 patients in 100,000 patient-years. Metformin causes lactate accumulation only in patients who have hepatic failure, renal failure or in patients who attempt suicide with high dosage of drugs. In this report, we present five patients who used high doses of metformin for suicide attempt."

Lactic acidosis is the most serious side effect, so it must not be administered to patients with renal, liver, or heart insufficiency. Only a few cases of hepatotoxicity due to this drug have been documented.

      "text": "PURPOSE: Metformin is the most commonly prescribed anti-diabetic medication. However, it is often used despite the presence of contraindications and in unlicensed indications. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of metformin use before hospitalization in spite of contraindications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to evaluate the prevalence of metformin - associated side effects.\n\nMATERIAL/METHODS: 558 hospitalized patients (mean age = 66.65 ± 12.73 years) with poorly controlled T2DM were enrolled. Detailed medical history including the duration of T2DM, duration of hypoglycemic agents usage prior to hospitalization and possible metformin-associated side effects was recorded. Patients were subjected to a thorough physical examination and indispensable biochemical and diagnostic research panel was performed to establish the degree of heart failure, sufficiency of the respiratory system and kidney function.\n\nRESULTS: 335 out of 558 patients were treated before hospitalization with metformin alone or in combination with other hypoglycemic agents, mostly sulfonylureas. Contraindications to metformin were found in 275 patients and despite this 120 of them were using this medication in an average dose of 1793.91 ± 701.61 mg. However, none of them reported any serious adverse effects and no significant pH changes were observed. Only three patients reported moderate dyspepsia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a relatively good tolerability of metformin by patients with the traditional contraindications to this drug. These findings support other authors' suggestion that indications and contraindications to metformin should be re-evaluated."

      "text": "Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent that is commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although metformin-associated gastrointestinal upset and metabolic acidosis is widely recognized side effect of this drug, metformin-induced liver injury has been rarely reported in the literature. In most cases reported, metformin-induced liver injury was associated with concomitant intake of other hepatotoxic drugs. Here, we report a case of a 70-year-old white woman who suffered metformin-induced liver injury 5 weeks after starting on this medication, and she was not on any other hepatotoxic agent. With increasing prescription of metformin, this case deserves particular attention for this rare but important side effect."
