    "text": "Adverse drug reactions are a major cause of illness and death. They cause 5-10% of general practice consultations and 5 to 10% of hospital admissions and would be the third or fourth cause of death (after heart attack, stroke and cancer). It is a failure of contemporary medicine. The purpose of pharmacoepidemiology is the study of drug use in populations and its impact on public health. The author describes the four stages of the recent history of pharmacovigilance. The first, spontaneous reporting, has identified many adverse drug reactions but cannot provide with incidence or risk estimates. Observational epidemiological research has shaped second generation pharmacovigilance, providing incidence and relative and absolute risks which are essential for public health decision taking. The meta-analysis of clinical trials would be third-generation pharmacovigilance: it has contributed to the understanding of relatively common adverse drug reactions with great impact on public health. Research on big data will surely be the basis of the fourth generation of pharmacovigilance."

Commonly observed signals were identified for index drugs acting upon the nervous system (34%), cardiovascular system (21%), and blood and blood-forming organs (15%), and many marker drugs were related to the nervous system (25%), alimentary tract and metabolism (23%), cardiovascular system (17%), and genitourinary system and sex hormones (14%). Negative controls and positive controls were utilized in 21% and 13% of studies, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The PSSA methodology has been used in 53 studies worldwide to detect and evaluate over 300 unique prescribing cascades signals. Researchers should consider sensitivity analyses incorporating negative and/or positive controls and additional time windows to evaluate time-varying biases when designing PSSA studies."

    "text": "Over the years since 1961 and the identification of thalidomide as the common link in thousands of birth defects, daily pharmacovigilance activities and signal generation have evolved from the analysis of individual case reports and imputology, to case series and underreporting, to spontaneous report databases and disproportionality analyses, to data mining in population databases. Regulatory requirements have also changed from purely passive monitoring and reacting to alerts to a proactive approach that includes risk management plans and risk minimization, and from reporting only by healthcare professionals to patient reporting and exploration of social media. The emphasis only on risk assessment is changing towards assessment of the risk/benefit ratio and the exploration of real-life efficacy studies to complement the measure of real-life risk. The interactions between industry and regulators have been amplified and strengthened. However, most adverse reactions, including severe ones, are related to well-known and often pharmacological effects of the older drugs, possibly with genetic predispositions. Prevention is the next frontier for pharmacovigilance, beyond simply generating alerts, and it involves not only the removal of drugs from the market, but also promotion of proper drug prescribing by better trained physicians and the proper use of drugs by better informed patients."

    "text": "In 2013, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) created a Working Group on Vaccine Safety (WG) to address unmet needs in the area of vaccine pharmacovigilance. Generating reliable data about specific vaccine safety concerns is becoming a priority due to recent progress in the development and deployment of new vaccines of global importance, as well as novel vaccines targeting diseases specifically endemic to many resource-limited countries (RLCs), e.g. malaria, dengue. The WG created a Guide to Active Vaccine Safety Surveillance (AVSS) to assist national regulatory authorities and national immunization program officers in RLCs in determining the best course of action with regards to non-routine pharmacovigilance activities, when confronted with a launch of a new vaccine or a vaccine that is new to their country. Here we summarize the results of the WG, further detailed in the Guide, which for the first time provides a structured approach to identifying and analyzing specific vaccines safety knowledge gaps, while considering all available sources of information, in order to determine whether AVSS is an appropriate solution. If AVSS is confirmed as being the appropriate tool, the Guide provides additional essential information on AVSS, a detailed overview of common types of AVSS and practical implementation considerations. It also provides a framework for a well-constructed and informative AVSS when needed, thus aiming to ensure the best possible safety of immunization in this new landscape."

    "text": "Drug safety and pharmacovigilance are rapidly changing with biomarkers and new technologies such as artificial intelligence. However, we need new ideas and application contexts for integration of biomarkers and emerging technologies in modern pharmacovigilance. A new concept, panvigilance, has been recently introduced for proactive \"stress testing\" of new drug candidates in panels of patients or healthy volunteers identified by biomarkers, and who are situated in population edges in terms of pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or molecular target interindividual variability. Panvigilance aims to provide upper and lower bound estimates for drug performance under conditions that mimic population edges. Subsequently, it becomes easier to extrapolate pharmacovigilance signals with regard to individuals who reside in between the population edges. In this expert review, we explain that the prefix \"pan,\" meaning everything or all, refers to the three-pronged panvigilance goals to (1) decipher the full population scale variability in medicinal product PKs and molecular target variability, (2) empower forecasting of pharmacovigilance signals within and across populations through knowledge of biomarker variations worldwide, and (3) integration of pharmacovigilance signals across government ministries, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders through, for example, institutional innovation such as centers for panvigilance. We note that panvigilance and pharmacovigilance are complementary, and underscore the added value of panvigilance for global clinical trials. Panvigilance offers a new opportunity for meaningful biomarker application in clinical trials beyond traditional contexts such as personalized medicine. In sum, panvigilance is a systems approach to pharmacovigilance and poised to innovate risk governance in medicinal product development and clinical trials."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Metformin has the potential for treating numerous diseases, but there are still many unrecognized and unreported adverse events (AEs).\n\nMETHODS: We selected data from the United States FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from the first quarter (Q1) of 2004 to the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2022 for disproportionality analysis to assess the association between metformin and related adverse events.\n\nRESULTS: In this study 10,500,295 case reports were collected from the FAERS database, of which 56,674 adverse events related to metformin were reported. A total of 643 preferred terms (PTs) and 27 system organ classes (SOCs) that were significant disproportionality conforming to the four algorithms simultaneously were included. The SOCs included metabolic and nutritional disorders (\n\nCONCLUSION: Most of our results were consistent with the specification, but some new signals of adverse reactions such as acute pancreatitis were not included. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate unlabeled adverse reactions and provide important support for clinical monitoring and risk identification of metformin."

Some studies have found that liver failure may be associated with a high plasma glutamine level. Consumption of this product may be linked to potential adverse effects. This report describes the first case of glutamine-induced hepatotoxicity. A 35-year-old female athlete with severe abdominal pain and scleral icterus was referred to the hospital. She had been taking glutamine powder for the past three weeks. Impaired liver function test and imaging evaluation suggested hepatotoxicity. Glutamine consumption was discontinued and the patient was closely monitored. Finally, after two weeks, the patient recovered successfully. This novel case was the first report regarding glutamine-induced hepatotoxicity. Health care providers must know that consumption of dietary supplements such as glutamine may be associated with serious side effects. Liver damage is a possible side effect of glutamine. Hence it is necessary to consider hepatotoxicity as an adverse reaction in case of glutamine supplement consumption."

Children (1 month-18 year), with newly diagnosed drug sensitive tuberculosis, started on daily FDC regimen of ATT, were included. Participants were followed up at 2 weeks, 8 weeks and 6 months. Division of AIDS (DAIDS) severity grading and World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) causality assessment was done.\n\nRESULTS: In 99 participants, 29 experienced ADRs. Most commonly ADRs involved hepatobiliary (11.1%) and gastrointestinal (8.1%) systems. Grade 3 severity noted in 35.5% ADRs. Certain causality classified in 19.3%. Presence of ADRs was significantly higher in participants with vs without malnutrition [40.5% vs 21.1% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036)]. Tendency for more severe ADRs noted in participants with vs without malnutrition [Grade 3 ADRs out of all ADRs: 64.7% vs 0% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001)].\n\nCONCLUSION: Incidence and severity of ADRs has increased after introduction of daily FDC of ATT. Most common ADR observed were hepatobiliary. Malnutrition and less weight for age were risk factors for occurrence and severity of ADRs."

    "text": "AIM: Treatment of type 2 diabetes with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may be limited by gastrointestinal side effects (GISE) in some patients. Risk factors for developing GISE are not known. We analysed patient characteristics that were associated with GISE among patients treated with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide.\n\nMETHODS: Data was obtained from an audit database of liraglutide use based in clinical practice in the UK. Patients were grouped into those who did not report GISE, those who reported GISE but continued liraglutide and those who discontinued liraglutide due to GISE within 26 weeks of treatment. Baseline variables of age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, weight, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, gender, ethnicity, alanine transaminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and diabetes treatment types were tested for possible associations with GISE outcome. Significant variables in univariate analyses were entered into ordinal logistic regression analyses.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 4442 patients were suitable for analysis. A total of 3905 (87.9%) did not report GISE, 297 (6.7%) and 240 (5.4%) had GISE and continued and discontinued treatment, respectively. Age, weight, eGFR, metformin status and insulin status were associated with GISE outcome in univariate analyses (P all <0.05). In the final regression model, age (adjusted OR 1.15 [95%CI 1.05,1.26], P=0.002) and non-metformin use (adjusted OR 0.76 [95%CI 0.60,0.96], P=0.020) were associated with worse GISE outcome.\n\nCONCLUSION: Older age and non-metformin use were associated with more significant GISE leading to discontinuation of liraglutide treatment. The reasons for these findings are unclear and warrant further investigation."

    "text": "PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to calculate the report rate of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related angioedema (ACEi-AE). Secondary objectives were to determine factors suspected to affect the likelihood of ACEi-AE being reported and to investigate potential differences in angioedema risks between different ACEis.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient data from two cohorts comprising 176 patients with ACEi-AE were compared with report data from the Danish Adverse Drug Reactions Database, administered by the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA). The study period was 1994-2015. Data were linked using unique personal identification numbers and birth dates. Cohort data and report data were compared with ACEi sales numbers from MedStat, an official database containing annual pharmaceutical drug sale data in Denmark.\n\nRESULTS: ACEi-AE was reported in two out of 176 cases resulting in a report rate of 1.1%, meaning that 98.9% of the cases were not reported. Since 1994, a total of 417 ACEi-AE reports were made to the DKMA. Fifty-eight percent of these were made by general practitioners or physicians with unknown workplaces and 35% by hospital staff. Enalapril and ramipril were the most sold ACEi's in the study period (40.3% and 42.6%, respectively). Enalapril was associated with 54.7% of ACEi-AE reports while ramipril was associated with 14.2%. ACEi substance received was known for 141 cohort patients, of which 53.9% were prescribed enalapril and 17.0% received ramipril.\n\nCONCLUSION: ACEi-AE was found to be severely underreported in Denmark, greatly limiting the available incidence data for this potentially life-threatening adverse reaction."

    "text": "PURPOSE: Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are used to discover previously unknown relationships between drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A plethora of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-ADR pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the ADR, since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the ADR's actual cause).\n\nMETHODS: Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of the Poisson mean), Bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, BCPNN) to sparse regression (LASSO), are compared in their ability to detect drug-ADR pairs in a large number of simulated SRSs with varying numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall curve is used to assess the measures' performance.\n\nRESULTS: Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the Poisson mean) perform best when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs. When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, Bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The LASSO proves to be the most robust against the innocent bystander effect.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There is no absolute \"winner\". Which method to use for a particular SRS depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data."

    "text": "The coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the development of mRNA vaccines with proven efficacy. However, it remains unclear whether patients who developed pericarditis after the first COVID-19 mRNA would be fit to receive the second vaccination. Herein, we present the case of a 64-year-old man who visited our emergency department with substernal chest discomfort that began 4 days after his first mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Acute pericarditis was diagnosed based on symptoms and ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram. Chest pain improved 2 days after treatment.Since there are no guidelines on whether to administer an additional vaccination to a patient who developed pericarditis after the initial vaccination, we considered whether or not to administer the additional vaccination. We informed the patient about the risks and benefits and decided to administer the second dose. He did not experience any major adverse reactions. The indications for the second vaccination need to be thoroughly considered."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: To summarise the reported lactic acidosis cases associated with metformin from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and estimate the incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) in Australia.\n\nMETHOD: All \"lactic acidosis\" cases associated with metformin and reported to the TGA between January 1971 and October 2014 were included. Data extracted included patient demographics, medical history and co-existing conditions, metformin dosage and relevant pathology results.\n\nRESULT: A total of 152 cases of suspected MALA were included in this study. For 20 patients the outcome was unknown. There were 23 patients (n=132, 17.4%) reported as deceased. Plasma lactate levels were higher in non-survivors (p=0.02). Thirty-five patients (n=132, 26.5%) were reported to have at least one pre-existing contraindication to the use of metformin; this proportion was not different between patients who died or survived. Renal impairment was the most common contraindication. Approximately 75% of patients were reported to have at least one clinical condition which might cause acidosis. Metformin dosage, plasma lactate and serum creatinine were not correlated. Based on the cases reported to the TGA, the incidence of MALA in Australia was estimated to be 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.1) cases per 100,000 patient-years between 1997 and 2011.\n\nCONCLUSION: Pre-existing clinical conditions, such as renal impairment, and acute illnesses associated with lactic acidosis were frequently reported in the cases of MALA. The estimated incidence of MALA was lower than in most previous studies in other countries, probably due to the nature of spontaneous reports to the TGA."
