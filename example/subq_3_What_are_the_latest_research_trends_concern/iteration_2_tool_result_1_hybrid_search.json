      "text": "Metformin, a widely used anti-diabetic drug, has garnered attention for its potential in cancer management, particularly in breast and colorectal cancer. It is established that metformin reduces mitochondrial respiration, but its specific molecular targets within mitochondria vary. Proposed mechanisms include inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I and/or Complex IV, and mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, among others. These actions lead to cellular energy deficits, redox state changes, and several molecular changes that reduce hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients. Clinical evidence supports metformin's role in cancer prevention in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Moreover, in these patients with breast and colorectal cancer, metformin consumption leads to an improvement in survival outcomes and prognosis. The synergistic effects of metformin with chemotherapy and immunotherapy highlights its potential as an adjunctive therapy for breast and colorectal cancer. However, nuanced findings underscore the need for further research and stratification by molecular subtype, particularly for breast cancer. This comprehensive review integrates metformin-related findings from epidemiological, clinical, and preclinical studies in breast and colorectal cancer. Here, we discuss current research addressed to define metformin's bioavailability and efficacy, exploring novel metformin-based compounds and drug delivery systems, including derivatives targeting mitochondria, combination therapies, and novel nanoformulations, showing enhanced anticancer effects."

      "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for various cancers, with the impact of anti-diabetic therapies on cancer progression differing across malignancies. Among these therapies, metformin has gained attention for its potential anti-cancer effects, primarily through modulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathway and the induction of autophagy. Beyond metformin, other conventional anti-diabetic treatments, such as insulin, sulfonylureas (SUs), pioglitazone, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, have also been examined for their roles in cancer biology, though findings are often inconclusive. More recently, novel medications, like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, have revolutionized DM management by not only improving glycemic control but also delivering substantial cardiovascular and renal benefits. Given their diverse metabolic effects, including anti-obesogenic properties, these novel agents are now under meticulous investigation for their potential influence on tumorigenesis and cancer advancement. This review aims to offer a comprehensive exploration of the evolving landscape of glucose-lowering treatments and their implications in cancer biology. It critically evaluates experimental evidence surrounding the molecular mechanisms by which these medications may modulate oncogenic signaling pathways and reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, it assesses translational research and clinical trials to gauge the practical relevance of these findings in real-world settings. Finally, it explores the potential of anti-diabetic medications as adjuncts in cancer treatment, particularly in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy, minimizing toxicity, and addressing resistance within the framework of immunotherapy."

Studies over the past few years have identified multiple novel molecular targets and pathways that metformin acts on to exert its beneficial effects in treating type 2 diabetes as well as other disorders involving dysregulated inflammation and redox homeostasis. In this mini-review, we discuss the latest cutting-edge research discoveries on novel molecular targets of metformin in glycemic control, cardiovascular protection, cancer intervention, anti-inflammation, antiaging, and weight control. Identification of these novel targets and pathways not only deepens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which metformin exerts diverse beneficial biological effects, but also provides opportunities for developing new mechanistically based drugs for human diseases."

In recent years, several studies have shown that metformin is a potential therapeutic agent against cancer, alone or combined with other anticancer treatments. Metformin mainly activates the AMPK complex and regulates intracellular energy status, inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species. Other anticancer targets of metformin are specific transcription factors inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis and reducing drug resistance. In addition, metformin modulates tumor cells' response to anticancer treatments, favoring the activity of T cells. In diabetic patients, metformin reduces the occurrence of cancer and improves the prognosis and efficacy of anticancer treatments. In this review, we provided a comprehensive perspective of metformin as an anticancer drug."

Preclinical studies have demonstrated several anticancer molecular mechanisms of metformin including mTOR inhibition, cytotoxic effects, and immunomodulation. Epidemiologic data have demonstrated decreased cancer incidence and mortality in patients taking metformin. Several clinical trials, focused on evaluation of metformin as an anti-cancer agent are presently underway. Data published from a small number of completed trials has put forth intriguing results. Clinical trials in pre-surgical endometrial cancer patients exhibited a significant decrease in Ki67 with metformin monotherapy. Another interesting observation was made in patients with breast cancer, wherein a trend towards improvement in cancer proliferation markers was noted in patients without insulin resistance. Data on survival outcomes with the use of metformin as an anti-cancer agent is awaited. This manuscript will critically review the role of metformin as a potential cancer treatment."

This literature review was undertaken to provide novel evidence concerning metformin intervention, with a particular emphasis on cancer treatment and prevention. Undoubtedly, the pleiotropic actions associated with metformin include inhibiting inflammatory processes, increasing antioxidant capacity, and improving glycemic and lipid metabolism. Consequently, these characteristics make metformin an attractive medicament to translate to human trials, the promising results of which were also summarized in this review."

      "text": "Cancer continues to pose a significant global health challenge, as evidenced by the increasing incidence rates and high mortality rates, despite the advancements made in chemotherapy. The emergence of chemoresistance further complicates the effectiveness of treatment. However, there is growing interest in the potential of metformin, a commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as an adjuvant chemotherapy agent in cancer treatment. Although the precise mechanism of action of metformin in cancer therapy is not fully understood, it has been found to have pleiotropic effects, including the modulation of metabolic pathways, reduction in inflammation, and the regulation of cellular proliferation. This comprehensive review examines the anticancer properties of metformin, drawing insights from various studies conducted in vitro and in vivo, as well as from clinical trials and observational research. This review discusses the mechanisms of action involving both insulin-dependent and independent pathways, shedding light on the potential of metformin as a therapeutic agent for different types of cancer. Despite promising findings, there are challenges that need to be addressed, such as conflicting outcomes in clinical trials, considerations regarding dosing, and the development of resistance. These challenges highlight the importance of further research to fully harness the therapeutic potential of metformin in cancer treatment. The aims of this review are to provide a contemporary understanding of the role of metformin in cancer therapy and identify areas for future exploration in the pursuit of effective anticancer strategies."

      "text": "Metformin, as the preferred antihyperglycemic drug for type 2 diabetes, has been found to have a significant effect in inhibiting tumor growth in recent years. However, metformin alone in cancer treatment has the disadvantages of high dose concentrations and few targeted cancer types. Increasing studies have confirmed that metformin can be used in combination with conventional anticancer therapy to obtain more promising clinical benefits, which is expected to be rapidly transformed and applied in clinic. Some combination therapy strategies including metformin combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been proven to have more significant antitumor effects and longer survival time than monotherapy. In this review, we summarize the synergistic antitumor effects and mechanisms of metformin in combination with other current conventional anticancer therapies. In addition, we update the research progress and the latest prospect of the metformin-combined application in the cancer treatment. This work could provide more evidence and future direction for the clinical application of metformin in antitumor."

In recent years, due to the few clinically effective treatment options including glioma, some scholars have proposed the possibility of metformin in the treatment of glioma, and studies have shown that metformin has a certain inhibitory effect on this tumor. This review explores the multiple mechanisms through which metformin exerts its antitumor effects, focusing on signaling pathways such as AMPK/mTOR, ferroptosis, autophagy, apoptosis and chloride ion channels (CLIC1). Metformin's inhibition of glioma proliferation involves complex cellular processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and modulation of immune responses. Additionally, metformin affects glioma stem cells by inhibiting key pathways, including STAT3, mTOR, and AKT, and altering the tumor microenvironment. While preclinical studies suggest that metformin enhances radiosensitivity and reduces tumor recurrence, its clinical application remains in early stages, with further studies needed to optimize dosing regimens and understand its full therapeutic potential. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of metformin's molecular mechanisms in glioma treatment and highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy, especially for treatment-resistant gliomas."
