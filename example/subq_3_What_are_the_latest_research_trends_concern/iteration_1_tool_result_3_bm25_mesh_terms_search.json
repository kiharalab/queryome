      "text": "BACKGROUND: At present, the antitumor effect of metformin is controversial. Previous meta-analyses included observational studies, of which the results can be influenced by many confounders, affecting the result of meta-analyses and weakening the strength of evidence. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to confirm the effect of metformin use on patients with advanced or unresectable cancers, including randomized clinical trials (RCTs).\n\nMETHODS: We searched for RCTs in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted to combine hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model.\n\nRESULTS: Finally, 7 eligible RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the combined results revealed that treatment with metformin did not improve the overall survival (OS) of patients (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.91-1.37, p>0.05), and there was no clear evidence that metformin use was related to improved progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.40; p>0.05). The pooled RR for grade III or IV adverse events was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.52- 1.60; p>0.05), indicating that the use of metformin was not significantly related to increased toxicity.\n\nCONCLUSION: Metformin does not significantly improve the survival of patients with advanced or unresectable cancer, regardless of cancer type and region."

Detailed mechanistic evaluations indicate that MF-induced hormetic-adaptive responses are mediated often via the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) protein and its subsequent upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Hormesis-induced protective responses by MF are largely mediated via a vast and highly integrated anti-inflammatory molecular network that enhances longevity and delays the onset and slows the progression of neurodegenerative and other chronic diseases."

      "text": "During the development of a wet granulated 850 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet formulation, the tablets exhibited high friability (>3% w/w) irrespective of the source of extra-granular magnesium stearate (MgSt). High friability values indicated that an anti-bonding effect of MgSt was too high to be overcome by 3.3% w/w povidone as a binder in the formulation with 1.5% w/w residual granule moisture. Increasing the povidone concentration up to 7% w/w showed limited improvement in friability, with tablets showing variable friability depending on MgSt source. Characterization of MgSt indicated differences in crystallinity, surface area and particle morphology between different vendors. In addition, a new bulk yield strength test, which determines the MgSt fragmentation tendency, was found to be indicative of the MgSt performance in the tablet formulation. To improve bonding properties of granules, residual granule moisture was increased to 2% w/w at different povidone concentrations. At 2% w/w residual granule moisture content, regardless of MgSt source, the tablets showed significant improvement in friability (∼0.6% w/w) even at the lowest povidone concentration (3.3% w/w). The bonding power of higher residual granule moisture had a greater impact than higher povidone concentration in overcoming the anti-bonding effects of magnesium stearate."

Already in the population of people leading an unhealthy lifestyle, before the formation of obesity and prediabetes metformin smooths out the adverse effects of a high-fat diet. Being prescribed at this stage, metformin will probably be able to, if not prevent, then significantly reduce the progression of all subsequent metabolic changes. To a large extent, this review will discuss the proofs of the evidence for this. Another recent important change is a removal of a number of restrictions on its use in patients with heart failure, acute coronary syndrome and chronic kidney disease. We will discuss the reasons for these changes and present a new perspective on the role of increasing lactate in metformin therapy."

Heterogeneity was evaluated through the Q test and I2 statistics. HRs and 95% CIs were pooled through either random-effect or fixed-effect models. Meta-regression, subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis and publication bias diagnosis were also performed.\n\nRESULTS: Seven studies with 5 426 343 subjects were included. Metformin use was associated with reduced risk of OC (HR=0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.87, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis suggested that the results were relatively stable.\n\nCONCLUSION: Metformin is associated with a reduced risk of OC. More well-designed studies are still needed to further elaborate on these associations.\n\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021237127."

      "text": "Recalls of some batches of metformin have occurred due to the detection of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in amounts above the acceptable intake (AI) of 96 ng per day. Prior to the recalls, an international regulatory laboratory network had been monitoring drugs for nitrosamine impurities with each laboratory independently developing and validating multiple analytical procedures to detect and measure nitrosamines in metformin drugs used in their jurisdictions. Here, we provide an overview of the analysis of metformin active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and drug products with 1090 samples (875 finished dosage forms (FDFs) and 215 API samples) tested beginning in November of 2019 through July of 2020. Samples were obtained internationally by a variety of approaches, including purchased, received from firms via information requests or selected by regional regulatory authorities (either at wholesalers or during GMP inspections). Only one nitrosamine (NDMA) was detected and was only present in some batches of metformin products. For API samples, 213 out of 215 lots tested had no measurable level of NDMA. For FDF samples tested, the number of batches with NDMA above the AI amount for patient safety was 17.8% (156/875). Based on these data, although the presence of NDMA was of concern, 82.2% of the samples of metformin drug products tested met quality and safety standards for patients. Regulatory agencies continue to collaborate extensively and work with marketing authorization holders to understand root causes of nitrosamine formation and agree on corrective actions to mitigate the presence of NDMA in future metformin batches."
