      "text": "AIM: Treatment of type 2 diabetes with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may be limited by gastrointestinal side effects (GISE) in some patients. Risk factors for developing GISE are not known. We analysed patient characteristics that were associated with GISE among patients treated with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide.\n\nMETHODS: Data was obtained from an audit database of liraglutide use based in clinical practice in the UK. Patients were grouped into those who did not report GISE, those who reported GISE but continued liraglutide and those who discontinued liraglutide due to GISE within 26 weeks of treatment. Baseline variables of age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, weight, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, gender, ethnicity, alanine transaminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and diabetes treatment types were tested for possible associations with GISE outcome. Significant variables in univariate analyses were entered into ordinal logistic regression analyses.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 4442 patients were suitable for analysis. A total of 3905 (87.9%) did not report GISE, 297 (6.7%) and 240 (5.4%) had GISE and continued and discontinued treatment, respectively. Age, weight, eGFR, metformin status and insulin status were associated with GISE outcome in univariate analyses (P all <0.05). In the final regression model, age (adjusted OR 1.15 [95%CI 1.05,1.26], P=0.002) and non-metformin use (adjusted OR 0.76 [95%CI 0.60,0.96], P=0.020) were associated with worse GISE outcome.\n\nCONCLUSION: Older age and non-metformin use were associated with more significant GISE leading to discontinuation of liraglutide treatment. The reasons for these findings are unclear and warrant further investigation."

However, it remains unclear whether patients who developed pericarditis after the first COVID-19 mRNA would be fit to receive the second vaccination. Herein, we present the case of a 64-year-old man who visited our emergency department with substernal chest discomfort that began 4 days after his first mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Acute pericarditis was diagnosed based on symptoms and ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram. Chest pain improved 2 days after treatment.Since there are no guidelines on whether to administer an additional vaccination to a patient who developed pericarditis after the initial vaccination, we considered whether or not to administer the additional vaccination. We informed the patient about the risks and benefits and decided to administer the second dose. He did not experience any major adverse reactions. The indications for the second vaccination need to be thoroughly considered."

      "text": "COVID-19 remains a deadly disease that poses a serious threat to humanity. COVID-19 vaccines protect the public and limit viral spread. However, public acceptance is significantly dependent on the efficacy and side effects (SEs) of the vaccinations being produced. Four important mechanisms have been examined for COVID-19 vaccines: DNA-based, mRNA-based, protein-based, and inactivated viruses. Vaccination safety research was formerly limited to manufacturer-sponsored studies, but numerous additional cross-sectional survey-based studies conducted globally have contributed to the generation of vaccine-related safety data reports. Twenty-seven studies and twenty-four case reports published-up till 2021 were overviewed for the presentation of SEs and their severity. Injection site pain remained the most dominant localized SE, while headache and fatigue were the most prevalent systemic SEs. Most studies reported that all vaccinations were safe, with very little or no adverse effects, but the nature of SEs was reported to be more persistent in DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines, while inactivated viral vaccines were associated with longer-duration SEs. Overall, SEs were found to be more dominant in women and youngsters. Case reports of adverse reactions have also been documented, but there is still a need to find out their pathological linkage with the COVID-19 vaccination."

Adult patients with Type 2 DM who were eligible for inclusion criteria switched from metformin tablet to metformin capsule. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), GI side effects, and patient satisfaction based on visual analog scale (VAS) were assessed during a 6-week follow-up of receiving metformin capsule.\n\nFINDINGS: One hundred and three patients were evaluated, and 75 patients participated in this study. At the baseline, 40 patients (53.3%) had GI side effects due to metformin tablet which was reduced to 16 patients (21.3%) after switching to metformin capsule (\n\nCONCLUSION: Switching to metformin capsule may result in less GI side effects, with no further side effect complications."

      "text": "Metformin has been widely used for over 5 decades. New preparations have been developed for possible enhancement of efficiency, tolerability, and pleiotropic nonglycemic effects. Extended-release metformin has contributed to adherence and improved gastrointestinal tolerability. Delayed-release metformin acts in the lower gastrointestinal tract and exerts glucose-lowering effects at lower plasma metformin levels, which might suggest use of this biguanide in patients with chronic kidney disease. Metformin is also known to have numerous nonglycemic effects. Results of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study indicate improvements in cardiovascular outcome and reduced total mortality independent of glycemic control. Anticancer effects of metformin have been discussed and many clinical trials are on-going. Metformin is noted for its beneficial effects on lifespan extension and on disorders due to increased insulin resistance. Further investigations, including randomized control trials in nondiabetic individuals, are required to demonstrate the nonglycemic effects of metformin."

      "text": "Studies examining the rates of negative effects of psychotherapy are rare and the reported rates differ widely. To be able to calculate adequate benefit-cost ratios in conjunction with different samples and settings, we need a deeper understanding of these effects. We therefore investigated whether different treatment settings would reveal varying rates and kinds of negative effects by recruiting patients from a psychiatric (n=93) and a psychosomatic rehabilitation (n=63) hospital. Negative effects of psychotherapy were assessed with the Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy post-treatment. To investigate whether patients' pre-treatment expectations have an influence on reported negative effects, patients filled in the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation prior to treatment begin. Patients from the psychiatric hospital reported an average 1.41 negative effects, with 58.7% reporting at least one negative effect. Those from the psychosomatic hospital reported 0.76 negative effects on average, with 45.2% of patients reporting at least one negative effect. The differences between these samples are significant. The two samples' top three reported types of negative effects are that patients had experienced more downs during or just before the end of the therapy, that patients had difficulty making important decisions without the therapist, and that patients were concerned that colleagues or friends might find out about the therapy. A regression analysis revealed that the clinical setting (psychosomatic rehabilitation hospital vs. psychiatric hospital) and expectations in the form of hope of improvement were significant predictors for negative effects of psychotherapy. Our study highlights the need to examine the negative effects of psychotherapy in different settings and samples to better evaluate the benefit-cost ratios of treatments for different patient groups. It also shows that we need guidelines for assessing and reporting negative effects."

      "text": "Metformin remains the oral drug of choice for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is an ideal anti-diabetic drug for maintaining good glycemic control in diabetics. However, the side effect profile of metformin varies from minor or no effects to substantial impact on the GI tract. In addition, metformin is rarely known for its association with nightmares. Here we present the case of a newly diagnosed 40-year-old diabetic who developed recurrent nightmares within a week of starting metformin treatment. The patient had no previous history of psychiatric or sleep disorders. However, it was the first time he had experienced such recurrent nightmares, especially after the start of 500 mg metformin thrice a day. Based on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Probability Scale, and sudden onset and disappearance of nightmares after metformin initiation and discontinuation made metformin the primary cause of his nightmares."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION: Metformin is among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide for a variety of indications. Although metformin has several important advantages, for example being easy to store and administer, it is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Slower-release formulations of metformin may reduce the incidence of side effects while maintaining efficacy; however, there is a lack of systematic evidence available to guide head-to-head comparisons between different metformin formulations.\n\nMETHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, OVID EMBASE, MEDLINE, The Cochrane database and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched (from inception to 25 January 2021). Trials that randomized adult participants to extended-release formulation of metformin (met-XR), delayed-release (met-DR) or immediate-release metformin (met-IR) were included. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk-of-bias, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, BMI, lipid profile and side effects. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.\n\nRESULTS: Fifteen studies (n = 3765) met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p = 0.93). A non-significant reduction in mean body weight was observed in individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR (- 1.03 kg, 95% CI - 2.12 to 0.05, p = 0.06). Individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (- 5.73 mg/dl, 95% CI - 7.91 to - 3.56, p < 0.00001). Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.80, p = 0.006).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate equal efficacy of longer-acting formulations (met-XR, met-DR) versus immediate-release metformin formulations in terms of glycaemic control. There were insufficient studies available to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations outside of diabetes care. However met-XR was associated with reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations, while met-DR was strongly associated with reduced GI side effects, which could improve drug compliance."

      "text": "AIMS: This study aimed to build a model-based predictive approach to evaluate the gastrointestinal side effects following an initial metformin medication.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The model was developed from data from four randomised clinical cohorts. A prediction model was established using integrated or simplified indicators. Ten machine learning models were used for the construction of predictive models. The Shapley values were used to report the features' contribution.\n\nRESULTS: Four randomised clinical trial cohorts, including 1736 patients with type 2 diabetes, were first included in the analysis. Seventy percent of participants (1216) were allocated to the training set, 15% (260) were assigned to the internal validation set and 15% (260) were assigned to the test set. The Extra Tree model had the highest area under curve (AUC) (0.87) in the validation and test set. The top five crucial indicators were blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sex, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC), and these five indicators were selected for constructing a simplified predictive model (AUC = 0.76). An online web-based tool was established based on the predictive model with integrated 17 features and top five indicators.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: To predict gastrointestinal side effects in diabetic patients for initial use of metformin, a few easily obtained features are needed to establish the model. The model can be applied to the Chinese population in clinical practice."
