Here's an overview of metformin based on recent research findings:

### Mechanism of Action
Metformin primarily works by reducing hepatic glucose production, mainly through the inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. This leads to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), crucial for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. It also affects glucagon signaling pathways, contributing to its effectiveness in managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) [1,2].

### Therapeutic Uses
Metformin is widely used as a first-line treatment for T2DM but has demonstrated potential in other areas like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammatory conditions. It shows promise as an adjuvant in cancer therapies and provides cardiovascular benefits by lowering oxidant stress and improving endothelial function [3,4].

### Side Effects
Common side effects of metformin include gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Extended-release formulations typically cause fewer problems. Lactic acidosis, although rare, remains a serious potential side effect and requires monitoring in high-risk individuals [5,6].

### Current Research Trends
Research is expanding metformin's application beyond diabetes management, particularly in cancer therapy. It's being explored for its ability to enhance chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Studies also focus on its involvement in key metabolic and inflammatory processes, showcasing potential therapeutic benefits in over 60 conditions [7,8].

### Conclusion
Metformin continues to be a cornerstone in diabetes management but holds potential for broader applications, including cancer treatment and cardiovascular protection. Its multifaceted mechanisms make it a candidate for repurposing in various clinical settings, underlining the importance of ongoing research to optimize its usage.
