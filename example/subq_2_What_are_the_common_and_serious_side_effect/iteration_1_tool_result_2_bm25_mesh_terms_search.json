      "text": "Metformin has been used for ages to treat diabetes mellitus due to its safety profile and low cost. However, metformin has variable pharmacokinetics in patients, and due to its poor oral absorption, the therapeutic doses are relatively high, causing unpleasant gastrointestinal adverse effects. Therefore, novel derivatives of metformin have been synthesized during the past decades. Particularly, after the mid-2000 s, when organic cation transporters were identified as the main metformin carriers, metformin derivatives have been under intensive investigation. Nevertheless, due to the biguanide structure, derivatives of metformin have been challenging to synthesize. Moreover, the mechanisms of metformin's action are not fully understood to date, and since it has multifunctional properties, the interests have switched to re-purposing for other diseases. Indeed, metformin derivatives have been demonstrated in many cases to be more effective than metformin itself and have the potential to be used in different diseases, including several types of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, the pleiotropic nature of metformin and its derivatives can also create challenges. Not all properties are fit for all diseases. In this review, the history of the development of metformin-like compounds is summarized, and insights into their potential for future drug discovery are discussed."

Exposure to ionizing radiation disturbs the redox homeostasis of cells and causes damage to proteins, membranes, and mitochondria, destroying a number of biological processes. After irradiation, MF activates cellular antioxidant and repair systems by signaling to eliminate the harmful consequences of disruption of redox homeostasis. The use of MF in the treatment of the negative effects of irradiation has great potential in medical patients after radiotherapy and in victims of nuclear accidents or radiologic terrorism."

      "text": "BACKGROUND: Metformin is the first prescribed drug for hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mainly by activating AMPK pathway, this drug exerts various functions that among them protective effects are of the interest.\n\nPURPOSE: Herein, we aimed to gather data about the protective impacts of metformin against various natural or chemical toxicities.\n\nRESULTS: An extensive search among PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted by keywords related to protection, toxicity, natural and chemical toxins and, metformin. Our literature review showed metformin alongside its anti-hyperglycemic effect has a wide range of anti-toxic effects against anti-tumour and routine drugs, natural and chemical toxins, herbicides and, heavy metals.\n\nCONCLUSION: It is evident that metformin is a potent drug against the toxicity of a broad spectrum of natural, chemical toxic agents which is proved by a vast number of studies. Metformin mainly through AMPK axis can protect different organs against toxicities. Moreover, metformin preserves DNA integrity and can be an option for adjuvant therapy to ameliorate side effect of other therapeutics."

      "text": "It is hypothesized that treating the general aging population with compounds that slow aging, geroprotectors, could provide many benefits to society, including a reduction of age-related diseases. It is intuitive that such compounds should cause minimal side effects, since they would be distributed to otherwise healthy individuals for extended periods of time. The question therefore emerges of how we should prioritize geroprotectors discovered in model organisms for clinical testing in humans. In other words, which compounds are least likely to cause harm, while still potentially providing benefit? To systematically answer this question we queried the DrugAge database-containing hundreds of known geroprotectors-and cross-referenced this with a recently published repository of compound side effect predictions. In total, 124 geroprotectors were associated to 800 unique side effects. Geroprotectors with high risks of side effects, some even with risk for death, included lamotrigine and minocycline, while compounds with low side effect risks included spermidine and D-glucosamine. Despite their popularity as top geroprotector candidates for humans, sirolimus and metformin harbored greater risks of side effects than many other candidate geroprotectors, sirolimus being the more severe of the two. Furthermore, we found that a correlation existed between maximum lifespan extension in worms and the likelihood of causing a side effect, suggesting that extreme lifespan extension in model organisms should not necessarily be the priority when screening for novel geroprotectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for prioritizing geroprotectors, suggesting spermidine and D-glucosamine for clinical trials in humans."

      "text": "AIMS: There has been an increase in prescribing and costs of oral hypoglycaemic agents in England and other countries. This study aims to investigate the trends in prescriptions, costs, and adverse events of metformin and metformin-based single pill drug combinations from 2015 to 2020 and explore why changes in use or cost are occurring.\n\nMETHODS: Prescriptions and costs data from Prescription Cost Analysis database and Interactive Drug Analysis Profiles presenting all suspected ADRs reported for each drug were examined. Pharmacy level prices were also obtained. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the trends in prescribing and costs.\n\nRESULTS: Prescribing and costs of metformin-based single pill drug combinations (as a percent mean change per year) saw an increase of 8.78% (95% Cl: 7.45%, 10.11%, p = 0.001) and 5.17% (95% Cl: 2.13%, 8.22%, p = 0.009) on average each year, respectively. Metformin was the most prescribed monotherapy drug between 2015 and 2020. The cost of prescribing metformin (as a proportion of total oral hypoglycaemic agents) has been reduced from 30% in 2015 to 17% in 2020. Metformin-dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (e.g., metformin-sitagliptin) combination was the most popular metformin-based single pill drug combination. The number of adverse drug reactions per million items dispensed shows that metformin has the lowest adverse drug reactions per million items compared to other oral hypoglycaemic drugs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, an increase in prescription items can be seen for metformin-based single pill drug combinations along with an increase in their costs in primary care in England between 2015 and 2020. There was a declining trend for the number of ADRs reported per million prescription items dispensed for metformin-containing single pill combinations, even though their prescription rate increased."

This study assessed whether RMM for five medicines are implemented in Dutch clinical guidelines.\n\nDESIGN: Descriptive study.\n\nMETHOD: Dutch clinical guidelines where treatment with valproate, fluoroquinolones, methotrexate, metformin or fluorouracil was recommended were identified. In those guidelines that had been updated after publication of the RMM, we determined whether RMM-information was included in the guideline.\n\nRESULTS: Out of 50 identified guidelines recommending treatment with one of the five medicines, only 21 (42%) were revised after RMM-implementation. Of these 21 guidelines, 12 (n = 57%) included RMM-related information.\n\nCONCLUSION: Uptake of RMM information in Dutch clinical guidelines is limited and RMM-publication does not prompt guideline updates. This suggests that guidelines alone are not an optimal way to inform health care professionals of new safety warnings."

Treatments initiated prior to onset of weight gain were compared with those that started once weight gain already had occurred.\n\nRESULTS: Although data are limited, adjunctive medications for weight management appear to be more effective when initiated at or near the time when patients are first exposed to antipsychotic medications. Interventions initiated later in the course of treatment-typically after weight gain already has occurred-rarely help patients return to their pretreatment weight. The most commonly used adjunctive intervention has been metformin.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Certain patients benefit from initiating metformin early in their exposure to second-generation antipsychotic agents. In particular, young, healthy patients beginning olanzapine or clozapine probably will experience less weight gain if they concomitantly initiate metformin."

      "text": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: With pioglitazone ban and subsequent revoking in India along with varying regulatory decisions in other countries, it was decided to carry out a systematic review on its safety, efficacy and drug utilization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in India and compare with the data from the European Medicines Agency Assessment Report (EMA-AR).\n\nMETHODS: Systematic review was performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, searching Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases using 'pioglitazone AND India AND human' and 'pioglitazone AND India AND human AND patient' and compared with EMA-AR. Spontaneous reports in World Health Organization VigiBase from India were compared with VigiBase data from other countries.\n\nRESULTS: Sixty six publications, 26 (efficacy), 32 (drug utilization) and eight (safety), were retrieved. In India, pioglitazone was used at 15-30 mg/day mostly with metformin and sulphonylurea, being prescribed to 26.7 and 8.4 per cent patients in north and south, respectively. The efficacy in clinical trials (CTs) was similar to those in EMA-AR. Incidence of bladder cancer in pioglitazone exposed and non-exposed patients was not significantly different in an Indian retrospective cohort study. There were two cases and a series of eight cases of bladder cancer published but none reported in VigiBase.\n\nINTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: In India, probably due to lower dose, lower background incidence of bladder cancer and smaller sample size in epidemiological studies, association of bladder cancer with pioglitazone was not found to be significant. Reporting of CTs and adverse drug reactions to Clinical Trials Registry of India and Pharmacovigilance Programme of India, respectively, along with compliance studies with warning given in package insert and epidemiological studies with larger sample size are needed."

All other authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nBackground: Metformin is the only approved first-line oral glucose lowering agent for youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Y-T2DM) but often causes gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, which may contribute to reduced treatment adherence and efficacy. Prebiotic intake may reduce metformin's side effects by shifting microbiota composition and activity.\n\nObjective: The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility and tolerability of a prebiotic supplement to improve metformin-induced GI symptoms and explore the changes in glycemia and shifts in the microbiota diversity.\n\nMethods: In a two-phase pilot clinical trial, we compared, stool frequency and stool form every 1-2 days, and composite lower GI symptoms (weekly) at initiation of daily metformin combined with either a daily prebiotic or a placebo shake in a 1-week randomized double-blind crossover design (Phase 1), followed by a 1-month open-labeled extension (Phase 2). Plasma glycemic markers and stool samples were collected before and after each phase.\n\nResults: Six Y-T2DM (17.2 ± 1.7y (mean ± SD), 67% male, BMI (42 ± 9 kg/m\n\nConclusion: Administration of a prebiotic fiber supplement during short-term metformin therapy was well tolerated in Y-T2DM and associated with modest shifts in microbial composition. This study provides a proof-of-concept for feasibility exploring prebiotic-metformin-microbiome interactions as a basis for adjunctive metformin therapy.\n\nClinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT04209075."
