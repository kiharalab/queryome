      "text": "An employee undergoing cancer treatment was prescribed metformin, a medication used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and currently used as adjunct therapy for cancer. Metformin's anti-inflammatory properties inhibit tumor growth. It is speculated that cancer cells develop a metabolism that enhances aerobic glycolysis, which promotes cell growth and increases the need for glucose. Metformin decreases insulin in the blood, which decreases the amount of glucose available to cancer cells, thus starving the cells of nutrition, resulting in cell death. This case study explores the role of metformin in cancer treatment, with implications for occupational health nurses."

      "text": "To study saliva and plasma bioequivalence of metformin in humans, and to investigate the robustness of using saliva instead of plasma as surrogate for bioequivalence of class II drugs according to the salivary excretion classification system (SECS).Plasma and saliva samples were collected for 12 h after 500 mg oral dosing of metformin to 16 healthy humans. Plasma and saliva pharmacokinetic parameters, 90% confidence intervals and intra-subject variability values were calculated using Kinetica V5. Descriptive statistics and dimensional analysis were calculated by Excel. SimCYP program V13 was used for estimation of effective intestinal permeability.Metformin was subjected to salivary excretion since it falls into class II (Low permeability/High fraction unbound to plasma proteins), with correlation coefficients of 0.95-0.99 between plasma and saliva concentrations. Saliva/plasma concentration ratios were 0.29-0.39. The 90% confidence limits of all parameters failed in both saliva and plasma. Intra-subject variability values in saliva were higher than plasma leading to need for higher number of subjects to be used in saliva.Saliva instead of plasma can be used as surrogate for bioequivalence of class II drugs according to SECS when adequate sample size is used. Future work is planned to demonstrate SECS robustness in drugs that fall into class III."

In 2011, the device received FDA approval for the treatment of large and giant aneurysms in the internal carotid artery extending from the petrous to the superior hypophyseal segments. However, as popularity of the device grew and neurosurgeons gained more experience, its use has extended to several other indications. Some of these off-label uses include previously treated aneurysms, acutely ruptured aneurysms, small aneurysms, distal circulation aneurysms, posterior circulation aneurysms, fusiform aneurysms, dissecting aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, and even carotid-cavernous fistulas. The authors present a literature review of the safety and efficacy of the PED in these off-label uses."

      "text": "Metformin is a biguanide, evolved as one of the most widely used medicines. The applications of this component include but are not limited to reducing blood glucose, weight loss, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Studies about other probable indications have emerged, indicating that this agent can also be utilized for other purposes. In this review, applications of metformin are noticed based on the current evidence. Metformin commonly is used as an off-label drug in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it worsens inflammation and should not be used for this purpose, according to the latest research. Metformin decreased the risk of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. It is an effective agent in the prevention and improvement of survival in patients suffering hepatocellular carcinoma. There is evidence of the beneficial effects of metformin in colorectal cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, breast cancer, urothelial cancer, blood cancer, melanoma, and bone cancer, suggesting metformin as a potent anti-tumor agent. Metformin shows neuroprotective effects and provides a potential therapeutic benefit for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It also has been shown to improve mental function and reduce the incidence of dementia. Another condition that metformin has been shown to slow the progression of is Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Regarding infectious diseases, tuberculosis (TB) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are among the conditions suggested to be affected by metformin. The beneficial effects of metformin in cardiovascular diseases were also reported in the literature. Concerning renal function, studies showed that daily oral administration of metformin could ameliorate kidney fibrosis and normalize kidney structure and function. This study reviewed the clinical and preclinical evidence about the possible benefits of metformin based on recent studies. Numerous questions like whether these probable indications of metformin can be observed in non-diabetics, need to be described by future basic experiments and clinical studies."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION: The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has increased among different surgical specialities for the treatment of various conditions. Androgenetic alopecia is a common condition, with severe attendant psychosocial implications. PRP injections for hair restoration have become a popular practice among plastic surgeons. We performed a meta-analysis comparing local injection of platelet-rich plasma versus control to evaluate this issue in order to investigate the effectiveness of PRP local injections for androgenetic alopecia.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic literature search was performed. Primary outcome was the increase in number of hairs. Secondary outcomes were the increase in hair thickness and the percentage increase in hair number and thickness. We performed random-effect analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Six studies involving 177 patients were retrieved and included in the present analysis. A significantly locally increased hair number per cm\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Local injection of PRP for androgenic alopecia might be associated with an increased number of hairs and some hair thickness improvement in the treated areas with minimal morbidity. The results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution as it consists of pooling many small studies. Larger randomized studies can verify this perception."

      "text": "Data are examined regarding possible waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing (i.e. biowaiver) for approval of metformin hydrochloride (metformin) immediate-release solid oral dosage forms. Data include metformin's Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) properties, including potential excipient interactions. Metformin is a prototypical transporter-mediated drug and is highly soluble, but only 50% of an orally administered dose is absorbed from the gut. Therefore, metformin is a BCS Class III substance. A BCS-based approval approach for major changes to marketed products and new generics is admissible if test and reference dosage forms have the identical active pharmaceutical ingredient and if in vitro dissolution from both are very rapid (i.e. at least 85% within 15 min at pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8). Recent International Council for Harmonisation BCS guidance indicates all excipients for Class III biowaivers are recommended to be qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar (except for preservatives, flavor agents, colorant, or capsule shell or film coating excipients). However, despite metformin being a prototypical transporter-mediated drug, there is no evidence that commonly used excipients impact metformin absorption, such that this restriction on excipients for BCS III drugs merits regulatory relief. Commonly used excipients in usual amounts are not likely to impact metformin absorption."

      "text": "The integrated in vitro--in silico--in vivo approach has emerged into a biopharmaceutical toolkit that could accelerate drug development and improve drug product clinical performance in patients. In the present study, the influence of physiologically based media and dynamic dissolution testing on drug release from two metformin hydrochloride immediate release products with proven bioequivalence was tested. Metformin-specific physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed based on a range of literature or in silico predicted data using gastrointestinal simulation technology implemented in the Simcyp software package. Various approaches were employed in order to estimate the human effective permeability which was used as input for metformin plasma profile simulation. Influence of the rate and extent of metformin dissolution on drug absorption was evaluated. Both convolution and deconvolution approaches were used in order to establish a correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data. The results obtained indicate that physiologically based dissolution media and glass bead dissolution device exhibit certain advantages over the compendial dissolution apparatus and simple buffers which tended to be over-discriminative. Gastrointestinal simulation technology implemented in the Simcyp Simulator was successfully used in developing drug-specific PBPK model for metformin. Simulations indicate that in vitro dissolution kinetics has no significant effect on metformin absorption, if more than 65% of drug is released in 1 hour. Level A in vitro-in vivo correlation was obtained using both convolution and deconvolution approaches."

In this open-label phase 1 study, 54 healthy volunteers (fasted, n = 38; fed, n = 16) were randomly assigned to receive one 500-mg MXR tablet that was manufactured by Merck Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing (Jiangsu) Co. or Merck KGaA. Respectively, the mean terminal half-life was 7.5 and 6.8 hours in the fasted group, and 6.7 and 9.1 hours in the fed group. Median times to maximum observed concentration were 3 and 4 hours (fasted group) and 6 hours (both products, fed group). No significant differences were observed in the metformin plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the last sampling time and maximum observed concentration between products. Geometric least square mean ratios for maximum observed concentration, AUC from time 0 to the last sampling time, and AUC from time 0 to infinity were nearly 100%; the corresponding 90%CIs for bioequivalence were within 80% to 125%. Diarrhea (26.4%), abdominal pain (5.7%), and nausea (3.8%) were the most common adverse events (AEs); AEs were mild. The mean AUC from time 0 to infinity (test and reference) was substantially increased by ≈45% in the fed condition (equivalent to a 1.5-fold dose increase); this means food increased net systemic availability but had no impact on AE incidence. This was considered in the study design, which included MXR administration with evening meals. MXR tablets were bioequivalent under fasted/fed conditions and were safe and well tolerated."

      "text": "The term 'clinical cemetery' is frequently used to characterize ischaemic stroke, one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term morbidity globally. Over the past two decades, a number of novel therapies have been investigated for ischaemic stroke. However, aside from mechanical thrombectomy, the only FDA-approved prescription for treating ischaemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator, which has a limited therapeutic period. Although post-stroke rehabilitation therapies are helpful in improving functional recovery, their benefits cannot be yielded promptly. Nowadays, drug repurposing might be an appealing approach to expanding therapeutic options for ischaemic stroke. During the last decade, metformin has been extensively researched as a potential repurposing medicine for ischaemic stroke, with a focus on both preventive and therapeutic approaches. With regard to the idea of repurposing metformin in ischaemic stroke, this review aims to compile the available data from pre-clinical and clinical trials, address and clarify any discrepancies, and offer solutions."
