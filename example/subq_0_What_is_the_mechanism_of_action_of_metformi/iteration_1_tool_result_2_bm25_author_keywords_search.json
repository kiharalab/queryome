      "text": "Diabetes as chronic civilization disease, very often occurs together with health disorders. One of the basic pharmaceuticals commonly used in her therapy is metformin. Many other positive effects, not related to diabetes, have been observed in tatients treated with metformin for a long time. These are: positive changes in diagnostiic parameters, protection against cancer development, less frequent occurrence of other pathologies and diseases, increased sensitivity to selected drugs (e.g. cytostatics), delayed aging processes of organism. In addition to the molecular changes resulting in a hypoglycemic effect, the most common modifications of gene expression have been described, indicated as the basis for the anti-aging, anti-atherosclerotic and anticancer effects of this drug and its effect on melanogenesis or the nervous system. The results presented in the study are very promising, but most of them relate to experiments carried out in cell cultures or animals. The possibility of obtaining similar effects in humans requires much more research."

Although there are many options for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, such as surgical resection, interventional therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and liver transplantation, the poor therapeutic effect seriously reduces the quality of life for patients and also increases the social and economic burden. Metformin is originally used as the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, but it has been found to play a certain effect in the prevention and treatment of malignant tumor.

      "text": "Metformin known as the first-line orally prescribed drug for lowering blood glucose in type II diabetes (T2DM) has recently found various therapeutic applications including in cancer. Metformin has been studied for its influences in prevention and treatment of cancer through multiple mechanisms such as microRNA (miR) regulation. Alteration in the expression of miRs by metformin may play an important role in the treatment of various cancers. MiRs are single-stranded RNAs that are involved in gene regulation. By binding to the 3'UTR of target mRNAs, miRs influence protein levels. Irregularities in the expression of miRs that control the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are associated with the onset and progression of cancer. Metformin may possess an effect on tumor prevention and progression by modifying miR expression and downstream pathways. Here, we summarize the effect of metformin on different types of cancer by regulating the expression of various miRs and the associated downstream molecules."

      "text": "In type 2 diabetes, ecological and lifecourse factors may interact with the host microbiota to influence expression of his/her genomes causing perturbation of interconnecting biological pathways with diverse clinical course. Metformin is a plant-based or plant-derived medicinal product used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes for over 60 years and is an essential drug listed by the World Health Organization. By reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, metformin increased AMP (adenosine monophosphate)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and altered cellular redox state with reduced glucagon activity, endogenous glucose production, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis. Metformin modulated immune response by directly reducing neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and improving the phagocytic function of immune cells. By increasing the relative abundance of mucin-producing and short-chain-fatty-acid-producing gut microbes, metformin further improved the host inflammatory and metabolic milieu. Experimentally, metformin promoted apoptosis and reduced proliferation of cancer cells by reducing their oxygen consumption and modulating the microenvironment. Both clinical and mechanistic studies support the pluripotent effects of metformin on reducing cardiovascular-renal events, infection, cancer, cognitive dysfunction, and all-cause death in type 2 diabetes, making this low-cost medication a fundamental therapy for individualization of other glucose-lowering drugs in type 2 diabetes. Further research into the effects of metformin on cognitive function, infection and cancer, especially in people without diabetes, will provide new insights into the therapeutic value of metformin in our pursuit of prevention and treatment of ageing-related as well as acute and chronic diseases beyond diabetes."

      "text": "Metformin is a synthetic biguanide that improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis. Aside being the first-line therapy for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), many pleiotropic effects have been discovered in recent years, such as its capacity to reduce cancer risk and tumorigenesis. Although widely studied, the effect of metformin on thyroid cancer remains controversial. Potential mechanisms for its growth inhibitory effects have been elucidated in various preclinical studies that involved pathways related to adenosine mono-phosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH), and the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Hyperinsulinemia increases cell glucose uptake and oxidative stress, and promotes thyroid cell growth, leading to hyperproliferation, carcinogenesis, and the development of malignant tumors. Furthermore, it has also been related to thyroid nodules size in nodular disease, as well as tumoral size in patients with thyroid cancer. Several clinical studies concluded that metformin might have an important role as an adjuvant therapy to reduce the growth of benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. This suggests that metformin might be useful for patients with differentiated or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance or diabetes."

      "text": "Metformin elicits pleiotropic effects that are beneficial for treating diabetes, as well as particular cancers and aging. In spite of its importance, a convincing and unifying mechanism to explain how metformin operates is lacking. Here we describe investigations into the mechanism of metformin action through heme and hemoprotein(s). Metformin suppresses heme production by 50% in yeast, and this suppression requires mitochondria function, which is necessary for heme synthesis. At high concentrations comparable to those in the clinic, metformin also suppresses heme production in human erythrocytes, erythropoietic cells and hepatocytes by 30-50%; the heme-targeting drug artemisinin operates at a greater potency. Significantly, metformin prevents oxidation of heme in three protein scaffolds, cytochrome c, myoglobin and hemoglobin, with Kd values < 3 mM suggesting a dual oxidation and reduction role in the regulation of heme redox transition. Since heme- and porphyrin-like groups operate in diverse enzymes that control important metabolic processes, we suggest that metformin acts, at least in part, through stabilizing appropriate redox states in heme and other porphyrin-containing groups to control cellular metabolism."

      "text": "Metformin is one of the most prescribed drugs in type II diabetes (T2DM) which has recently found new applications in the prevention and treatment of various illnesses, from metabolic disorders to cardiovascular and age-related diseases. Metformin improves insulin resistance (IR) by modulating metabolic mechanisms and mitochondrial biogenesis. Alternation of microRNAs (miRs) in the treatment of IR-related illnesses has been observed by metformin therapy. MiRs are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in RNA silencing, targeting the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of most mRNAs and inhibiting the translation of related proteins. As a result, their dysregulation is associated with many diseases. Metformin may alter miRs levels in the treatment of various diseases by AMPK-dependent or AMPK-independent mechanisms. Here, we summarized the therapeutic role of metformin by modifying the aberrant expression of miRs as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in diseases in which IR plays a key role."
